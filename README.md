## Project Purpose

This project is inspired by the "Cronica" application and aims to learn the `MVVM-C` design pattern along with `unit testing`.

### Project Goals
The primary goal of this project is to understand and implement the MVVM-C (Model-View-ViewModel-Coordinator) design pattern. Through this project, the following objectives are targeted:
- Learn the MVVM-C design pattern: Understand the core principles and how to apply them effectively in a Swift-based iOS application.
- Implement Coordinators: Set up a basic Coordinator to manage navigation flows within the application.
- Set up a TabBar: Establish a TabBar using a Coordinator to switch between different sections of the application.
- Unit Testing: Demonstrate how to unit test the Coordinator classes.

### Notes: 
This application uses [TheMovieDB API](https://developer.themoviedb.org/reference/intro/getting-started) to fetch movie data.
